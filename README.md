- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fredrevel
- 👀 I’m interested in alternative politics, singing in chorals, french folk dance, walking, garden, my goats, birds...
- 🌱 I’m currently preparing concerts in choral, we will play Brahms' German Requiem
- 🌱 I’m currently working in a big company  which uses only Microsoft softwares for office works...
-  and I've been refused using Outlook for the very first time "they" decide to impose it to all the employees. Almost all followed, since several ones resisted.
-  2 days ago, my PC (Windows 10) has been modified, I saved my emails, but I've lost my Davmail configuration, and even my address has been changed.
-  we have a 2FA (it works fine 2 days ago).
- 💞️ I’m looking for domeone to help me recovering an operational environment, so I work again, and could help 4 colleagues who didn't migrate yet... but know even less than I do...
- Could anybody help me, please?
- 📫 How to reach me : frederic.andreani@free.fr
